  ebs: {
    shape: cylinder
  }
  elb: {
    shape: oval
  }
  rds: {
    shape: circle
  }

  ec2_instances -> ebs: attach
  ebs -> ec2_instances: store
  elb -> ec2_instances: route_traffic
  ec2_instances -> rds: interact
  rds -> ec2_instances: respond
  elb <-> ec2_instances: distribute_traffic
}

The code is valid and syntactically accurate for D2. The components are named properly, and the relationships between them are well-illustrated. The `multiple: true` property is used correctly for the EC2 instances to indicate that there are multiple instances.
